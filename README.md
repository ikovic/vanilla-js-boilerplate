# vanilla-js-boilerplate
Simple boilerplate for vanilla JS projects

## Description
Boilerplate contains just a blank project with a few generic things set up:
- ESLint with recommended rule set
- Prettier
- Pre-commit hook which runs ESLint & Prettier on all JS files

## Usage
After cloning the repo, run `npm i` to install the dependencies. Only the following script is available:
- `npm start` - defaults to `node index.js` for quick start
